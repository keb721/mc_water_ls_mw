Lattice-Switching Monte Carlo Code for the mW water model

Initially created for the work reported in [D. Quigley, "Thermodynamics of stacking disorder in ice nuclei", *J. Chem. Phys* 141, 121101 (2014)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4896376). Now used to experiment with parallelisation, optimation etc in the context of Lattice-Switching Monte Carlo calculations.
